![Chart](https://raw.github.com/adamflanagan/requests/master/example.png)

An application to make https requests to a site and chart the response time and status of each request. 

Originally used to test the effect of different load balancer configurations on response times and the number of dropped requests when servers restart, applications recycle etc.
